In this pa- per, we propose an improved model, TPH-YOLOv5 based on YOLOv5 [21] to solve the above-mentioned three prob- lems. The overview of the detection pipeline using TPH- YOLOv5 is shown in Fig.2. We respectively use CSPDark- net53 [52, 2] and path aggregation network (PANet [33]) as backbone and neck of TPH-YOLOv5, which follows the original version. In the head part, we first introduce one more head for tiny object detection. Totally, TPH-YOLOv5 contains four detection heads separately used for the detec- tion of tiny, small, medium, large objects. Then, we replace the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) [7, 49] to explore the prediction potential. To find the attention region in images with large coverage, we adopt Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM [54]) to sequentially generate the attention map along channel- wise and spatial-wise', metadata={'source': 'data/YoloV5.pdf'}),\n"," Document(page_content='[5] Liang-Chieh Chen, George Papandreou, Iasonas Kokkinos, Kevin Murphy, and Alan L Yuille.
